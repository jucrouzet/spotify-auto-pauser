# What and Why? #
I got tired of pausing Spotify every time I walked away from my computer and then unpausing it when I got back so I wrote a quick little tool to do it for me since I always lock/unlock my computer.  That's just about all it does right now.  There's also a tray icon that provides a one-click play/pause.

# Usage #
Download the .zip, unzip it, run setup.exe, then launch the program...that's about it.

While it's running, any time you lock your computer Spotify will pause and then resume when you unlock it.  There will also be a ||> icon in your system tray.  You can left click it to do a quick pause/play.  If you right click, you'll see an option to launch it on startup and a button to quit.
